# c
Just a small repo for me to do C experimentation.

## My thoughts
I quite like C. It's a language that is very simple yet so very powerful.
You can learn the language in a day (the specification is quite small),
so that you can get working on actual problems swiftly.

However, this does mean that C doesn't have a lot of the "sugar" most
other languages provide. Especially with my stint in Haskell, C has
quite a few things missing that I would want in a language for most
tasks. It is often tedious to do some tasks and missing out on easy
to use higher abstractions is a big blow for me.

Then again, C was made a long time ago in a world where different things
were important. It still excels at being a "portable assembly" language,
allowing you to have a lot of control over your memory and instructions
without the need of architecture specificity.

Overall I admire C a lot and would gladly use it again, especially for
tasks involving a lot of hardware constraints. Embedded systems anyone?
However, I believe that I will stick to higher level languages for most
of my programming. I will always try to brush up on my pointer skills though XD.

Another Note: I struggle with finding reasons to learn C++. It is a higher level
language that seems to have a lot of what I said was missing from C. However,
it seems that it is held back by backwards-compatibility guarantees, which
forces C++ to keep sub-optimal design decisions. It also seems overly complex
due to it's long existence. TBH, I feel like diving deeper into something like
Rust or getting more experience with C would be a better use of my time. C++ seems
to be absolutely dominant in the graphics industry though.

## raylib-testing
Me testing out raylib. It's a pretty cool library.
